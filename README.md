_Nepali word for "let's talk"_

Bolam is a decentralized peer-to-peer chat app that lets you connect directly with others without relying on central servers or storing any data.

### What Bolam Can Do?
- You can join channels to chat with people worldwide or enable location access to discover and talk with users nearby. 
- All data, including your location, stays only in your browser, ensuring privacy. 
- Built on torrent technology, Bolam bypasses censorship while giving you full control to easily add or remove trackers, making your conversations private, resilient, and truly yours.
- Upload and share files

### Todo:
- Message Syncronization incase any messages are not received by some clients.
- Better UI for making it a chat app (Signal & Whatsapp) rather than chat room app like (Bitchat).
- Extra levels of encryption to make the messages very private and secret.
- Convert to Mobile app using [Capacitor](https://capacitorjs.com/).
